# Refresh Tables in the SQL Endpoint

There is a public REST API for synchronising the delta tables in Onelake with the SQL Analytics Endpoint.
Details on the REST API can be found [here.](https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=datawarehouse)

## New REST API
An updated REST API has been released, which follows the long running operation [(LRO)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/fabric/articles/long-running-operation) implementation.   It is slightly different from the old REST API.   
Please update any references to the old REST API, to use this new one.

### User Data Function example
[Using a service principal](./RefreshTableinSQLEndpoint.py) - This example is for a User Data Function.   Copy and paste the code into a new User Data Function and add the libraries.   This can be called from other services in Fabric, i.e. notebooks and pipelines.


### Notebooks examples
