## 2025.4.2

- Improved FUAM_Item_Analyzer_Report and underlying semantic model
- Enhanced table schema for 'aggregated_activities_last_30days' table in   '03_Aggregate_Activities_Unit' notebook

- Fixed [Issue 85](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-toolbox/issues/85) by improving 'Capacity Compute' report page
